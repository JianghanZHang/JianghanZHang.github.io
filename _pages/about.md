I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu), [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu).

My research interests focus on the intersection of optimal control, numerical optimization, and machine/reinforcement learning for robotics. Specifically, I am interested in contact-rich manipulation and legged locomotion -- to enable robots to intelligently and robustly interact with complex real-world environments.

Over the last two years of my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) at the [Machines in Motion Lab](https://www.machinesinmotion.org/), NYU, where I focused on robotics, optimal control, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). In the summer of 2023, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work under the guidance of [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) at the [AI4CE Lab, NYU](https://ai4ce.github.io/), on an egocentric action prediction algorithm using LSTM for human-robot interaction.
