**Can first-order methods achieve the same performance as (established) second-order methods when used at high frequency in MPC?**
**Key words: Machine learning, HRI, Real-world Scenarios, Obstacle Avoidance, Human action prediction**

- Augmented the size and diversity of the EgoPAT3D dataset, and enhanced the baseline algorithm using a large pre-trained model and human prior knowledge.
- Proposed HRI demonstrations, showcasing real-world scenarios where a human and a robot share a common workspace.
- Developed an obstacle avoidance controller using DDP with customized soft constraints to avoid the predicted human action target.
- Integrated the algorithm with controllers for obstacle avoidance and reaching, then successfully deployed the combined system on a UR10e for real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) demonstrations.
